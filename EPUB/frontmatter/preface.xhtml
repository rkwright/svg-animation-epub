<h1>Preface</h1>
<p>This book is an exploration of the various methods available to animate SVG, including declarative SVG animation,
	JavaScript and CSS3 animation. These explorations have take place sporadically over almost 2 decades. The author,
	Ric Wright, is one of the original members of the SVG working group and a member of the team that developed the Adobe
	SVG Viewer (ASV) as well as the SVG authoring tools at Adobe. The author was in fact responsible for most of the
	import/export code at Adobe, including Illustrator and Indesign as well as LiveMotion (never shipped).</p>
<p>Ric is currently the Director of Engineering for the <a href="http://readium.org/">Readium</a> project, which is an
	open-source	foundation dedicated to providing web apps and a SDK for rendering <a href="http://idpf.org/epub/301">EPUB</a>, the
	standard format for eBooks. As a demonstration of the capabilities of EPUB and Readium, Ric took these examples and
	created this EPUB. </p>
<p>The details of how this book was created are covered in the colophon at the end of the book.</p>
<p>If you have any feedback, suggestions or bug reports about this book, you are strongly encouraged to contact
	<a href="mailto:rkwright@readium.org">Ric</a> directly.</p>
